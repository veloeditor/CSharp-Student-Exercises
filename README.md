# Tracking Student Exercises: Custom Types

You are going to build a console application that tracks exercises that are assigned to students at Nashville Software School. These are the constraints and requirements for your application.

## Entity Relationship Diagram

First, build an ERD based on these requirements using [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io).

## Setup

> **Note:** Make sure that each class you define is in its own file. Also make sure each class is in the `StudentExercises` namespace.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/workspace/csharp/StudentExercises && cd $_
touch Student.cs Cohort.cs Instructor.cs Exercise.cs
dotnet new console
```


## Student

You must define a type for representing a student in code. A student can only be in one cohort at a time. A student can be working on many exercises at a time.

### Properties

1. First name
1. Last name
1. Slack handle
1. The student's cohort
1. The collection of exercises that the student is currently working on

## Cohort

You must define a type for representing a cohort in code.

1. The cohort's name (Evening Cohort 6, Day Cohort 25, etc.)
1. The collection of students in the cohort.
1. The collection of instructors in the cohort.

## Instructor

You must define a type for representing an instructor in code.

1. First name
1. Last name
1. Slack handle
1. The instructor's cohort
1. The instructor's specialty (e.g. jokes, snack cakes, dancing, etc.)
1. A method to assign an exercise to a student

## Exercise

You must define a type for representing an exercise in code. An exercise can be assigned to many students.

1. Name of exercise
1. Language of exercise (JavaScript, Python, CSharp, etc.)

## Objective

The learning objective of this exercise is to practice creating instances of custom types that you defined with `class`, establishing the relationships between them, and practicing basic data structures in C#.

Once you have defined all of your custom types, go to your `Main()` method in `Program.cs` and implement the following logic.

1. Create 4, or more, exercises.
1. Create 3, or more, cohorts.
1. Create 4, or more, students and assign them to one of the cohorts.
1. Create 3, or more, instructors and assign them to one of the cohorts.
1. Have each instructor assign 2 exercises to each of the students.

## Challenge

1. Create a list of students. Add all of the student instances to it.
    ```cs
    List<Student> students = new List<Student>();
    ```
1. Create a list of exercises. Add all of the exercise instances to it.
    ```cs
    List<Exercise> exercises = new List<Exercise>();
    ```

Generate a report that displays which students are working on which exercises.

# Assigning Student Exercises with LINQ

In the last exercise, you had the instructors assign exercises to students.

```cs
Instructor.AssignExercise(exercise, student);
```

For this exercise, you need to create 4 new `List` instances to `Program.cs`: one to contain students, one to contain exercises, one to contain instructors, and one to contain cohorts.

After your code where you created all of your instances, add each one to the lists.

```cs
List<Student> students = new List<Student>() {
    Larry,
    Kristin,
    Loshanna,
    Tre
};

List<Exercise> exercises = new List<Exercise>() {
    OverlyExcited,
    SolarSystem,
    CarLot,
    DynamicCards
};

// Same for instructors and cohorts
```

1. List exercises for the JavaScript language by using the `Where()` LINQ method.
1. List students in a particular cohort by using the `Where()` LINQ method.
1. List instructors in a particular cohort by using the `Where()` LINQ method.
1. Sort the students by their last name.
1. Display any students that aren't working on any exercises (_Make sure one of your student instances don't have any exercises. Create a new student if you need to._)
1. Which student is working on the most exercises? Make sure one of your students has more exercises than the others.
1. How many students in each cohort?

# Inheritance for Students and Instructors

Find any common properties and/or behaviors on students and instructors and create a new parent class for both of them to inherit from.

```cs
public class NSSPerson
{
    // What common properties will go here?
}
```
